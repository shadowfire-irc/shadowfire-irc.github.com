NickServ is the network service responsible for keeping track of who owns which nicknames.

Before you can register channels with [ChanServ](../chanserv/about.html) or create groups with [AresServ](../aresserv/about.html) you will need a [registered nickname](registering.html). Some [channel modes](../modes/channel.html) will also prevent unregistered nicknames from joining or communicating in a channel.

Users are encouraged to make use of the NickServ `HELP` command and information
set out in the [introduction](../introduction.html).
