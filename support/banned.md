### What do I do?

You can start by [contacting](contact.html) support. In order to assist you, we need the following information:

* The exact kill message you received; the message should look similar to the following:

      [shadowfire] -!- ERROR Closing Link: nim[127-0-0-1.static.sagonet.net] ([Caladan.ShadowFire.ORG] Local kill by nim (brb))

* The complete message you receive when attempting to connect to the network.

**NOTE:** Without the entire message it is nearly impossible to find the matching Z-Line / G-Line.


### Why did this happen?

More than likely, it happened as a result of either a spamfilter match, open proxy monitors, or you violated one of our [rules](aup.html).
