### History

Shadowfire started off in early 1998 and has since grown to become one of the
largest and most actively frequented South African IRC networks. Since the
beginning, we've had, and continue to have, a very active international
userbase. ShadowFire aims to maintain this diversity into the future, providing
a reliable and enjoyable means for our present and future communities to
interact and grow.


### Acceptable Use Policy

All users are expected to have read, understood and agreed to abide by the
[Acceptable Use Policy](aup.html) before using the IRC network.


### Abuse

In recent years IRC networks have become the target of many forms of abuse.
Shadowfire has been no exception. As a result, and in the best interests of our
users, Shadowfire reserves the right to do everything in its power to prevent
the abuse of our network and associated services and hardware.

This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that all clients who connect to
the network are connecting from secure hosts. This entails scanning of all
clients upon connection to the network for insecure SOCKS and other such
proxies.

Shadowfire expressly prohibits the use of its network to host botnets or any
other such automata or trojans. Channels found to be hosting bots will be shut
down without notice. It should be noted that owners will lose access to all
bots in the channel at the time of closure.
