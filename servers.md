Server                 | Ports                |

### Clients

If you're new to IRC, you'll first need an IRC client before you can start chatting. Wikipedia has an [extensive list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients) of IRC clients for all platforms.

If you're unable to install new software or just unable to use one of the above IRC clients, then [Mibbit](http://www.mibbit.com/) might be helpful.
