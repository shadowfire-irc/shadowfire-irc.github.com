Like everything else in the world, this resource is not perfect and probably
never will be. You can help us get it closer to perfection by reporting any
kind of error / issue you come across.


### Things you should report

 * Spelling / grammar mistakes;
 * Linked pages that don't exist;
 * Mislinked pages;
 * Offensive or abusive content;
 * Misinformation.

### Where to report to

Any of the above issues (or anything else that seems wrong) should be reported to any of the [points of contact](support/contact.html).
