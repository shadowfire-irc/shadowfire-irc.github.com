ChanServ is the network service responsible for keeping track of which channels belong to which users, user access privileges for channels and a host of other channel-related states.

Before you can register channels with ChanServ you will need a [registered nickname](../nickserv/registering.html).

Users are encouraged to make use of the ChanServ `HELP` command and information
set out in the [introduction](../introduction.html).
