Affiliate groups are regulated by Shadowfire network operators and cannot be
created directly by users. Users wishing to create a new group should submit
their request via the [Affiliate group request form](http://ares.shadowfire.org/Hostreq/).

**NOTE:** It is **strongly** suggested that you read the [guidelines](guidelines.html) to avoid requesting a group that _will_ be rejected.
