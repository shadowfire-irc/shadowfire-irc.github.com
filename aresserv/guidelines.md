It is **strongly** suggested that these guidelines are read carefully and followed closely in order to help you submit a request that will accepted.

 * Understand that AresServ groups are intended for *groups*, they are meant to be shared by users in a community, and are thus different from Vhosts.
 * If you already have an AresServ group **DO NOT APPLY FOR ANOTHER ONE**, it *will* be rejected.  First leave your current group, see [aresserv/Leaving Groups](leaving.html) for more information;
 * If you are not fairly high up on the access list of the associated channel **don't** bother applying yourself, request a channel operator apply;
 * Don't get other people to apply on your behalf, this almost always results in losing control of your group;
 * Use as few periods (`.`) as possible, the more you have the less likely your request will be accepted;
 * This is not your domain, do **NOT** submit things like `mycooldomain.co.za`, these *will* be rejected outright;
 * Only use alphanumeric characters (`a-Z`, `0-9`), `.` and `-`;
 * Don't include your nickname, this will be prepended (inserted at the beginning) to your user mask **automatically**;
 * Requests are scored based on various criteria:
   * First and foremost is the association between the channel name, the group name and the mask that you choose.
   * Every period (`.`) in the group reduces the score dramatically, **use as few as possible**.

After reading these guidelines *carefully* you can proceed with [aresserv/Registering](registering.html).
