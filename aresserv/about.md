AresServ is the network service responsible for keeping track of affiliate groups and their members.

See [aresserv/Registering](registering.html) for more information on creating
affiliate groups. It is strongly suggested that you read the
[guidelines](guidelines.html) for an idea of what to do and what to avoid.

Before you can register affiliate groups with you will need a [registered nickname](../nickserv/registering.html).

Users are encouraged to make use of the AresServ `HELP` command and information
set out in the [introduction](../introduction.html).
